# WinEFIMounter
Windows tool to mount your Hackintosh EFI partition.
[a.k.a. MountEFI for Windows].

## Introduction
WinEFIMounter is a simple Batch program that makes it easy to mount the EFI partition on your Hackintosh drive directly from Windows. It could be used to mount any EFI partition (also Windows and Linux ones) from a Windows environment, but its main purpose is to let you mount your Hackintosh EFI partition without having to boot it. It's hard to believe but in reality there isn't any simple software such as [Corpnewt](https://github.com/corpnewt)'s [MountEFI](https://github.com/corpnewt/MountEFI) (for Mac) that lets you do it from Windows: you would have to download third-party programs. Try WinEFIMounter instead: it's light and easy-to-use!
