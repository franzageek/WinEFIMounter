The main reason I decided to create this program for is the fact that there isn't ANY MountEFI-LIKE TOOL FOR WINDOWS! 

I was trying to repair my Hackintosh EFI I had _accidentally_ fucked up with, and I was negatively surprised when I learned that there wasn't any MountEFI alternative for Windows. So I did it my way, by playing around with Diskpart. But the procedure was long and boring, so I created a script that could automatically mount the partition, and then slightly modified it to make WinEFIMounter.

I hope that you can save the time you'd have spent on downloading 3rd-party programs by using WinEFIMounter.
