This project began out of necessity when I needed to repair my Hackintosh EFI but couldn't find a version of MountEFI for Windows.
So I did it my way, by playing around with Diskpart. But the procedure was long and boring, so I created a script that could automate all that, and then slightly modified it to turn it into the WinEFIMounter _we know and love_.

I hope WinEFIMounter helps save you time and effort by offering a lightweight, easy-to-use alternative to third-party programs.

Thanks to all of ya that decided to star, clone & download WinEFIMounter! Really appreciate it <3
