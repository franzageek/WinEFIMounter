WinEFIMounter is a simple, standalone C++ program designed to make mounting the EFI partition on your Hackintosh drive **directly from Windows** easy. 

While it can mount any EFI partition (including those from Windows and Linux), its primary purpose is to allow you to access your Hackintosh EFI without having to boot into macOS. 

It's hard to believe but in reality _**there isn't any simple software**_ such as [Corpnewt](https://github.com/corpnewt)'s [**MountEFI**](https://github.com/corpnewt/MountEFI) (for Mac) that lets you do it from Windows: you would have to download **third-party programs**. You might as well try WinEFIMounter instead: it's lightweight and easy to use!
