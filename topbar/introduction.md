WinEFIMounter is a simple and standalone C# program that makes it easy to **mount the EFI partition** on your Hackintosh drive **directly from Windows**. 

It could be used to mount any EFI partition (also Windows and Linux ones) from a Windows environment, but its main purpose is to let you mount **your Hackintosh EFI partition without having to boot it**. 

It's hard to believe but in reality _**there isn't any simple software**_ such as [Corpnewt](https://github.com/corpnewt)'s [**MountEFI**](https://github.com/corpnewt/MountEFI) (for Mac) that lets you do it from Windows: you would have to download **third-party programs**. 

You might as well try WinEFIMounter instead: it's light and easy to use!
