The main reason I decided to create this program is the fact that there isn't ANY MountEFI VERSION FOR WINDOWS! 

I was trying to repair my Hackintosh EFI I've _accidentally_ fucked up with, and I was negatively surprised when I learned there wasn't any MountEFI version for Windows. So I did it my way, playing around with Diskpart. Then I created a script that could automatically mount the partition, and then slightly modified it to make WinEFIMounter.

I hope that with WinEFIMounter you can save the time you would have spent downloading a 3rd-party program.

I hope you find it useful.
